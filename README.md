# Inventory-Management
Python based project build with Jupyter Notebook.
In the program(Inventory_Management.ipynb) , user can purchase different products which are listed by the program.
When user selects all the products he want to buy, a bill is generated indicating the products purcahsed by him and the total amount to be paid.
After then the products are updated in the inventory which is based on file system.
Whenever user purchases anything the transaction is recorded in a json file(Sales.json)  which has the data about the purchased products,
date and time of purchase and the total bill amount.
The products data are stored in json file(Records.json).
The products in the inventory can be updated(Re-stocked) by Admin_Inventory.ipynb program.
Moreover, Admin_Inventory program also provides a feature to add new products in the inventory.
